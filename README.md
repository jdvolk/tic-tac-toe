**Project Description**

  This is a tic-tac-toe game that is designed to play with another person on the same computer. Each person takes turns with the mouse to choose a space that they would like to put their token (ether an X or an O). The game detects after a move if it was a win or a draw. If neither of those two things are true, then the game continues.

  The game will update on the top of the page with the win status including their token or state if the game was a draw. After a person wins, The winning board is saved to their side of the screen. These displays are updated from local storage so when the page is reloaded or visited again at a later time, their scores will still be there.

**Project Goals**

* Create a functioning game with the use of JavaScript and updating local storage and the data model.
* Make it completely playable from the console before the DOM handling
* Use variables, event listeners, event handlers, classes and functions to update the DOM then use classes to handle the heavy lifting of storage and the data structure. 
* Utilize local storage so that the game persist across browsers and reloads.
* Attempt to have very clean JavaScript and CSS code and refactor whenever possible with a goal of readability.
